1. For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!
2. A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:
- adding a feature in development
- collaborating on the same project with other developers
- not breaking your entire repository
- not upsetting your co-workers
3. Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if you keep up to date with their changes.
4. Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs). Tips
